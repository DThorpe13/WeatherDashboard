# WeatherDashboard

This project consists of an up to date weather dashboard. 
The live data is called from the Open Weather API.

When clicking onto the page, you will find a mostly blank screen, with a search bar in the upper left hand corner titled "Search for a City:" and here you will input the city you are searching for.

Once the information has been sent, the information will be stored and saved in local storage, where you will be able to keep tabs of the cities you have searched for. 

Then the home page will display all of the live data for weather, including a 5 day forecast for the city you have searched.

For examples and Images of the pages functionality, please check into the Assets folder.

Thank you!
